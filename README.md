 * Base 
 * Lyra Chain 
 * Metal L2 
 * Mode 
 * Orderly Mainnet 
 * RACE Mainnet 
 * Zora 
 * OP Sepolia Testnet

 * Mode Testnet 
 * RACE Testnet 
 * Zora Sepolia Testnet 
 * Base devnet 0 
 * OP Labs Sepolia devnet 0 

## More about the Superchain Registry

The Superchain Registry hosts Superchain-configuration data in a minimal human-readable form and includes mainnet and testnet Superchain targets, along with their respective member chains.

Other configuration, such as contract-permissions and `SystemConfig`parameters are hosted and governed onchain.

A list of chains in the registry can be seen in the top level[`chainList.toml`](./chainList.toml) and [`chainList.json`](./chainList.json) files.
These files are autogenerated from scripts in the registry and will remain stable to build against.
